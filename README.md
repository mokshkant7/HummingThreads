To run this project you have to have either Android Studio or VsCode setup along with Flutter SDK.

In case you don't have it you can click on the following links.

For Android Studio:
https://developer.android.com/studio

For Flutter SDK:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install


Now if you have both the Android studio and Flutter setup all you have to do is clone the Repository.

Cheers !
